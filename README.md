# Abato-
In the AbatoƆ project, I collaborated with my team to transition Ghana’s election system from traditional to electronic collation, enhancing transparency and accuracy. We developed a secure e-voting platform with streamlined voter registration, barcode-enabled voting, and a cloud-based database for efficient result dissemination.
